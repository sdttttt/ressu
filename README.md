# Ressu

[![build](https://github.com/sdttttt/ressu/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sdttttt/ressu/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a modern **RSS Reader**, built using React in Tauri, and it's aimed at Windows platforms, but it's not finished yet. Please be patient... 

*Of course, it's free.*


## Dev

You need the following environment:

- Rust
- Node.js
- pnpm (node package manager)
- wasm-pack

After WASM compile complete, need **reinstall node_modules** to found wasm library. It is imported as link in package.json.

## TODO

- [x] Layout.
- [ ] RSS parse.
- [ ] Local storage.
- [ ] Deep UI Design.
