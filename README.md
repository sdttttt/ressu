# Ressu

This is a modern **RSS Reader**, built using React in Tauri, and it's aimed at Windows platforms, but it's not finished yet. Please be patient...


## Dev

Ressu is based on `tauri`, `react` and `wasm`.
You need the following environment:

- Rust
- Node.js
- pnpm (node package manager)
- wasm-pack

After WASM compile complete, need reinstall node_modules.


## WASM

Ressu is i also an  attempt on wasm, and her rss acquisition and parsing will be done by Rust.
