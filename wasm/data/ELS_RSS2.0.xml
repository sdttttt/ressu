While much of it remains lost, from time to time some pieces reappear.</div></div><div class="article__body"><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text">You may think you have bought some great finds at Goodwill, the national non-profit of thrift shops, or gotten some good deals but rest assured Laura Young has you beat.</div></div><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text"><strong>In 2018, the antiques dealer saw a Roman-style marble bust at Goodwill in Austin, Texas, and thought it looked older and more valuable than the $35.99 price sticker indicated, so she decided to bring it home and see if her hunch would pay off.</strong></div></div><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text">She had no idea how right she was. After bringing it to two different auction houses, it was determined that it wasn’t just a Roman style bust, it was Roman. The bust is believed to be from around the 1st century AD.</div></div><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text"><strong>How it ended up sitting under a table in a Goodwill in Texas remains a mystery. But unfortunately for Young, subsequent research revealed that she would not be allowed to sell or keep the bust.</strong></div></div><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text">The Bavarian government determined that the bust was once owned by the Bavarian King Ludwig I, who acquired it sometime before 1833. He displayed it at Pompejanum, a replica of a Roman Villa in Pompeii that Ludwig built in the town of Aschaffenburg.<br><br><strong>Pompejanum was damaged heavily by allied bombing during World War II and much of the art was destroyed or stolen. That is likely what happened to the bust Young found, either stolen by an American soldier or bought by an American soldier from someone who stole it. Presumably, the statue made its way to Texas when the soldier returned home. Thousands of pieces of art were brought to the United States by American soldiers after World War II. Goodwill was unable to help determine who donated it because they do not keep records of donors.</strong></div></div><div class="article__block" data-type="text"><div class="article__text"><strong>Because Germany never relinquished their claim on the item, Young cannot claim ownership of it or sell it. It took four years of negotiation, partially because of the pandemic and partially because these things <em>just take a long time,</em> but a deal was struck and the bust will be returned to Germany, eventually.
